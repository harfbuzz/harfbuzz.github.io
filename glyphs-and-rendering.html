      The main purpose of HarfBuzz is shaping, which creates a list of positioned
      glyphs as output. The remaining task for text layout is to convert this list
      into rendered output. While HarfBuzz does not handle rasterization of glyphs
      per se, it does have APIs that provide access to the font data that is needed
      to perform this task.
    </p>
<p>
      Traditionally, the shapes of glyphs in scalable fonts are provided as quadratic
      or cubic Bezi√©r curves defining outlines to be filled. To obtain the outlines
      for a glyph, call <code class="function">hb_font_draw_glyph()</code> and pass a
      <span class="type">hb_draw_funcs_t</span> struct. The callbacks in that struct will be called
      for each segment of the outline. Note that this API provides access to outlines
      as they are defined in the font, without applying hinting to fit the curves
      to the pixel grid.
    </p>
<p>
      Fonts may provide pre-rendered images for glyphs instead of or in addition to
      outlines. This is most common for fonts that contain colored glyphs, such as
      Emoji. To access these images, use <code class="function">hb_ot_color_reference_png()</code>
      or <code class="function">hb_ot_color_reference_svg()</code>.
    </p>
<p>
      Another way in which fonts provide colored glyphs is via paint graphs that
      combine glyph outlines with gradients and allow for transformations and
      compositing. In its simplest form, this can be presented as a series of
      layers that are rendered on top of each other, each with its own color.
      HarfBuzz has the <code class="function">hb_ot_color_glyph_get_layers()</code> to
      access glyph data in this form.
    </p>
<p>
      In the general case, you have to use <code class="function">hb_font_paint_glyph()</code>
      and pass a <span class="type">hb_paint_funcs_t</span> struct with callbacks to obtain paint
      graphs for glyphs that have them. The <code class="function">hb_font_paint_glyph()</code>
      API can handle outline and image glyphs as well, so it provides a unified API for
      access to glyph rendering information.
